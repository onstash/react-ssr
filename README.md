## React server side rendering with nodeJS

My own boilerplate for building React server-side rendered applications using express & react-router.

## Why?

I didn't want to re-invent the wheel of routing (client & server) in the name of saving a few kilobytes from the final bundle.
It was more of a hack and less of a sturdy replacement for `react-router`.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. Let us discuss in [issues](https://github.com/onstash/react-ssr/issues) before you raise a pull request for a feature request or a bug fix. I understand how much time and effort goes into a pull request. I personally don't & won't enjoy "declining" a pull request because of objective differences.

## TODO
- [x] Add README.md
- [x] Bundle server side using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [ ] Replace express with fastify if there is significant performance gain
